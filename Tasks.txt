1) Wire up template click targets
$(".template_link").onClick handler:
a) find "template type" from data attribute (e..g, data-template="row")
b) call a function addNode(currentNode, )

append : add as last child
prepand: add as first child
before: add before (as a sibling before)
after: add after (as a sibling after)


addNode(to_node)



2) Create a global id (attached to window object) and autoincrement on every click / addition of an element
3) So, we'll need some sort of "create new element" function that takes the name of a template, a location, and attaches the new node
4) Wrap these new targets in the id
5) Have a function that translates a global id (e.g., 16) into its corresponding "tree view" id (perhaps, "tree_node_16") and "page" id (e.g., "page_node_16")
6) Have another function that translates a tree or page view id (e.g., "tree_node_16" or "page_node_16") back into its corresponding id (16)
7) Create a dialog that appears the first time a user clicks the "Insert" button that explains how to use the site via the keyboard shortcuts (or the button), perhaps with a button that allows people to "dismiss" or "Create a Node right now"
