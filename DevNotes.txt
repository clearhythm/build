For Insertion Rules:


WORK TO DO
*  DONE Shortcut keys
*  Templates (insert into tree, view)
    How it will work: We're going to have several ways to go into "input" mode, with these shortcut keys:
    , = before
    . = after
    < = prepend
    > = append
    Once you are in an "insert" mode, you are looking at an input added to that spot, and you can type into the input...
    'Enter' key tries to enter a node into the Tree, using following rules:
      If you hit enter with no keys typed, it does nothing,
      If you hit enter with keys typed, it tries to match the key sequence to a template.  If it finds one, it inserts it, and appends a new node (for fast repeat typing)
      If it doesn't find one, it highlights the row as an error state "template not found"
    'Esc' key removes you from input mode (first time) and deselects the node on the tree (second time)

    We will use a new input in the line, you can type in the input (indented like before, and background highlight like before)
    If user clicks away OR clicks enter, do the validation check
      Valid? Replace the input with the template node we wanted
      Invalid? Remove the input li (and select previously selected node)
*  Insertion rules (use approach below)
*  Grab HTML button (just spit out the view's HTML, and use JQuery .each to strip out an ids that match 'view_' string)

INSERTION RULES
----
We'll declare a global associative array

rules [];

rules.tag.whitelist = [] (an array of named elements that are "allowed")
rules.tag.blacklist = [] (and array of named elements that are not "allowed")

e.g., p.whitelist = ['a']

or h1.blacklist = ['h2'];

if there is no tag for the thing we're looking up (e.g., a 'row') then we assume all templates are fair game
